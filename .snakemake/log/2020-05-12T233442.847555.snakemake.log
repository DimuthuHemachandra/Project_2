CreateCondaEnvironmentException:
Unable to check conda version:
ERROR: The install method you used for conda--probably either `pip install conda`

supported install methods include the Anaconda installer and the miniconda
installer.  You can download the miniconda installer from
https://conda.io/miniconda.html.
